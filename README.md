# eatWell

### Summary
---
eatWell is a food experience review, dietary optimizer assistant, mobile responsive, user source, Foursquare and AngularJS powered web application.

  - search the Foursquare database of venues to find your dining location
  - select the desired venue location
  - create a post with your diet specific specifications
  - search for a post with similar tags to find out about where you're going to eat

eatWell is currently still under construction.

This project is designed to implement a standard Create - Read - Update - Destroy style database to front-end interaction.
AngularJS framework is the essential toolbase used for the front-end side and Firebase is the functional framework of the database.

##### How it works:
pulls from the foursquare API

### Motivation

This project comes from my personal experience dinning out and having trouble with finding on menu options for my personal dietary restrictions and needs. As well it comes from the same type experiences with so many of my friends and family and the lack of clarity to eat at a restaurant and know fully whether the food meets their personal dietary needs.
